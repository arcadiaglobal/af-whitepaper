# The Arcadia Foundation DAO Whitepaper

> We'll be using this repo to share and request contributions to our whitepaper. 

You can contribute changes to improve the form like: typos, grammar, or redacting things to make them clearer. Just edit the file and send a push.

Now if you want to alter the original concepts, numbers, or operational design, then you should open a discusion first; We'll study the viability of implementing them. 

Additional machine translations will be added and if you are a native speaker then you can also help us to check for any issues.

We are open to any improvemnts in the presentation and spirit of the whitepaper, but some things just require technical or even legal checks. Other than that feel free to participate.
