# The Arcadia Foundation DAO Whitepaper

On founding a decentralized project starting with 0 budget and 0 trust.

William F. Galeano

## 1.0 Arcadia.Global

This DAO exercise is the staging part, for the DLT[^1] branch, of a decentralized holding enterprise. Meaning, that we also deal with other fields orbiting services and real assets. So, DLT is just one of the things we do, although it'll eventually integrate with most of those other fields; For now, it is its own thing.

This is a project with real challenges, about real assets, and for real people.

## 2.0 Foundation -both the act and the thing-

The AF project is about developing an organization from absolute scratch by giving access directly to the community into the project at a stage earlier than most founders usually do. The project then builds based on the changes this early participation implies, and on structuring the operations based entirely on a decentralized venue, its tools, and logic boundaries.

By the time almost any crypto project releases a Whitepaper, a company has already spent any non 0 sum of crypto assets, be it for development, infrastructure, the initial contractors and services; or at the very least, a fund for those expenses later on.

But what happens when a founder or collective faces a (lack of) regulation or simply the funds to kickstart its blockchain idea with cryptoassets and a company?

In the conventional business space one can simply **bootstrap** the idea and work several roles in parallel. Is not uncommon, and the global project has been developed like that. But is not that straightforward in crypto; Where some jurisdictions might not differentiate a founder buying some crypto assets to use them as "raw materials" or "FIAT equivalent" from just buying them with a speculative intention.

### 2.1 Regulatory Black Holes

So while in the conventional space you might even get a tax return for some of your bootstrapping efforts. In the crypto space those activities might compromise any fundraising, e.g. if deemed[^2] a direct outcome of such initial crypto purchase.

Case in point, in a starting-from-scratch scenario, a fundraising loot might be taxed on the founder the same way as the proceeds from winning a lottery would. Or even worse, the fundraising act could be considered irregular for someone's particular venue, even though the funds never leave the blockchain space and their custodial is collective.

We call these "regulatory black holes" They are not evident, and **you have to start avoiding them from very far away**. They happen everywhere, but for the most part, in jurisdictions where crypto is not outright banned or restricted, but there are only bare-bone regulations and precedents.

These partial regulations are most of the time the result of the institutional panic that past *bullruns* have created at periods of time. And so, they address mostly 1<sup>st</sup> generation crypto paradigms and dynamics that do not apply to later developments, with an opportunistic focus on taxing to boot.

### 2.2 Foundingception

Simple projects with a single product or service *already done elsewhere* might get away with replicating past exercises by similar companies and paying predictable legal fees. But when a project is not 100% crypto, has no equivalent, and has to (eventually) interact with other jurisdictions and establishment models, the crypto development comes with the need to invest in significant legal research before the team can find the correct way to set up everything.

And while there are a lot of things that can be built before that, if you don't have a jurisdiction you start with 0 trust, if is by lack of certainties or funds makes not much of a difference. For a crypto project in particular, it is thought of as a good signal to have this assurance. The point is that establishing to a specific venue protects the users and investors.

The thing is, even when recent advances and improvements in regulation across a wide range of countries have been significant[^3], this hasn't stopped the scams, rug pulls, insider trading, backdoors, manipulation, and outright token mills that don't even care to pretend their *meme coins* will have any use.

**Is like bad actors will be *bad actoring* jurisdiction or not**, so let's try something different in order to offer trust: Wouldn't it be more productive to bake-in the compliance directly into the project's logic and operations?

In a way, you could say that regulation, as it is, weighs more on those who want to innovate in the space by integrating and bridging, than those that openly peddle a fad. Conventional Fi might see something similar by equivalent actors following well-defined rules; But the distributed technology that was supposed to innovate there gets choked between assurance and regulatory friction[^4].

This project is about validating the ways and steps to overcome these pillar issues by "open sourcing" and crowdfunding the business formation activities from the very beginning, to bring transparency to phases of development usually handled behind closed doors.

We are finding ways to turn the usual red flags into opportunities for everyone. We call it altssurance.

## 3.0 Project Outline

The Arcadia Foundation DAO is a decentralized collaborative exercise aimed at: the team-building, technological development, crowdfunding, and functional establishment of the organization that will take care of our blockchain enterprise operations in the conventional business space.

We have termed this experimental framework a **Staging DAO**, aiming to prove the potential for self-regulation and coordination outside of a single jurisdictional framework.

This is not a creative way to say that we just go around regulations, in fact is the total opposite, because our policies and operations follow an aggregate of regulations from multiple spaces and business frameworks.

Because in our case and for our vision, creating and validating a maximum-common-denominator self regulation has way more upside than just skipping any of them with ill intents. Not to mention that in other spaces of the project the founder is putting his property on the line[^5].

We are creating an encompassing operative regulation built upon those structures to create an equivalent entrepreneurship format that can autoregulate until it gets enough traction, and then be translated back into a conventional establishment.

This, no doubt, puts some handicap at the time of fitting and competing with the market as a whole, that is why we don't do that. We will not be wasting resources on rehashing something already done and that doesn't advance the industry meaningfully. Now that is the handicap that the community should care about, the monotonic conceptual variety in the crypto industry that leads to a saturated ecosystem.

The project's scope is defined from the start by formulating a set of objectives that upon completion make the Staging structure unnecessary, besides its documentary, notary, and ledger functions.

### 3.1 The Project Objectives

From the DAO's home page:[^6]

> **Crypto Clean-Room:** Everything you see around its been developed by a team of one with the help of grants, faucets, and good old freeloading. To avoid regulatory black holes, the founder didn\'t invest in it with his crypto assets, and will not profit in any way from the DAO other than with his salary.

> **Formal Equivalence:** The DAO is set up and its operations should be equivalent to conventional business establishment models. That is the proof-of-concept part where we take this exercise to our regulators in the context of our local crypto sandbox.

> **Regulatory and Legal Framework:** Validate and double-check our original research and with that establish the whole formal framework. To be able to begin actual operations and build our chain based on a solid foundation.

> **Chain Testnet:** The last step and hard requirement of the DAO is to begin its own-chain development and deliver a testnet to stage the migration process. We will not be reinventing the wheel here, just making it all-terrain for our operational landscape.

The objectives are guidelines themselves aiming to foster trust in the project by self-restricting certain dynamics that might promote misbehavior or ambiguity about the process and finality.

In a way, this project is also a sandbox to experiment and find a way to startup something from 0, which becomes a proof of concept with operations, and a model with success.

For example, voiding and pegging the monetary value of tokens might appear counterproductive from the POV of fundraising, but matched with the model we talked about above, more than makes for it in the conventional business space.

When reviewing what we do you should always remember that we operate in **parallel** at various stages of progress and from multiple points of view.

### 3.2 The OSP (Original Sales Proposition)

That crypto ought to allow access to monetary self-determination and global finance to anyone anywhere on earth has been one of the main themes of the crypto ethos starting with the Bitcoin Whitepaper[^7]. But the truth is that, by being developed and readily accessible to developed nations first in its history, the gap between those and the rest of of world economies kept widening, but not in the usual ways.

At extreme peaks, a single blockchain transaction cost in BTC and ETH have gone up to \$62 and \$69[^8] USD respectively, which might be a significant chunk of a minimum wage in most of the world, even in the least expected places[^9]. And on average, TX costs on those chains are usually above what an average meal might cost in most places. Is not strange if most citizens of developing markets -in a high inflation economy- consider crypto-based solutions a thing for the wealthy.

This also emphasizes the speculative nature of crypto because is only worthy to hold if it serves as a way to generate extraordinary returns that support its usage. The other utilities and potential are relegated to an *academic* space both by users and the conventional business space.

And this is for a purely sparse usage like transferring value. When talking about real-time DEX or operating interactions, the average transaction count will be higher, so even the benefits of using L2 chains[^10] are not entirely extensible to these scenarios.

Adjusted by the cost of living and convenience[^11], crypto remains a potential but tricky way **to integrate and extend** this alternative economy into the sectors and value flows that keep the world running: shelter, food, jobs, utilities, infra.

This is at the core of why those crypto massification initiatives usually fail. And nobody can blame the idealistic or opportunistic founder who wants to change that from the outside. Even when intention is not enough most of the time, we -having explored the path- can't blame those who came before us and did not push for it. After all, projects that explore the unknown to build unprecedented things[^12] usually take more than one try.

Thus far, is interesting that the same processes and paradigms from the original industrialization repeat on the DLT revolution despite that now anyone can "download a machine" and the gatekeepers are not the academics, politics, and economists of old; but a nonuniform group of global citizens from the most unexpected backgrounds united by the technology.

What the Foundation -both the act and the thing- wants to do is precisely challenge these paradigms and finally develop an *in-situ* solution, universal enough, to definitely take advantage of the all potential benefits of blockchain-based tangible assets exchange, regardless of the economic development level of your nation. Blockchain ought to and can be above that.

Leveling the field opens the opportunities for mutual collaboration, **across diverse economic development levels** that don't rely on those incentives of colonialism and industrialization, but are more in sync with the open source nature that brought all this industry to life.

Is a way of saying that the gold rush already passed and the industry now should start to innovate outwards on top of the infrastructure and experience gathered in the rush.

## 4.0 Problems - a crypto project in hard mode -

A conventional crypto project would list problems that the product is meant to solve. We are going to list the problems we already solved because those are the foundations of how we plan to operate this, while sometimes being the actual alpha testing of our future solutions:

Being an impermanent[^13] exercise sets us apart from full-crypto projects and shields the project from most of the speculative nature of the usual fundraising formats. This is because fundraising is not at the center of everything but just another function of the collective. Having small fundraising limits, but no individual caps, also makes it necessary to limit the whales' appetite, organically.

A conventional project creates reserves for multiple parties within the project under the **assumption** that the project will run indefinitely, and those reserves will be worth a lot more later. We all know this is not the case for most projects and the source of the soft-scam most prevalent for workers in the blockchain industry.

We instead make it clear -from the start- what will be the value of our Loot peg token upon project success. And reserve 30% of these tokens to be used with this nominal value for paying any professional service before any funding is committed. For workers and contractors, these are like IOUs with a shot of bond[^14].

Starting with 0 assets in any wallet balance means that every funding activity and individual plays by the same rules, and makes final accounting transparent for everyone, including tax authorities. We are not recycling people, work, or funds from any previous project, it really, demonstrably, starts from scratch.

A straightforward offering model results in a hard-coded fundraising cap which ought to be enough for a lean structure operating in a short time frame, and below what most regulations consider a cutoff for vigilance. The idea is that moderate sums of money are easier to track by a wide range of participants, where every one of them can act as an auditor into the operations since **all of them go through the DAO**.

Is true that serious money requires serious establishment and regulation. But it can also be true that a wider self-regulation window wouldn't only foster more innovation, but work as a kind of filter at the same time.

It is known that around 90% of startups fail[^15], so the *filter* in this context is not just about the 10% that made it, is about how many of those 90% shouldn't have gotten the opportunity to blow investor money in the first place also.

This is how we view it from both sides of the aisle: as a startup and as a future VC-like entity.

Giving the community in general the earliest level of access makes this possible as long as the correct talent can find their way into the team. But this access level would still discriminate[^16] in favor of those who have crypto assets to invest right away. Also, a project starting from scratch necessarily lacks a team, so we made those two problems solve each other: by prioritizing access to the project to those in the community with no funds, or those who would rather commit their talent and experience to a position or task paid in those tokens.

The experienced crypto native would point out that this is nothing novel and is one of the features of a DAO. The truth is that before any DAO has a product or tokens in the treasury -different from the native ones- not many are willing to commit to it, with their work or otherwise. Not to mention that **the baseline role** of DAO tokens makes them securities[^17], with the long tail of gotchas this brings, the most critical being how restricted is to offer them to the public, the whole of it.

DAOs cause this exception where regulation for financial instruments hinders the possibilities and efficiency of this model; Besides questioning the universal freedom of individuals to self-organize and work on something they hired themselves to do.

What's different about this project is that we like playing nice with those regulations, as elaborated in a previous section. There is no other way for an unleveraged grassroots idea to get in the game and offer a different point of view.

That alternative vision should start from staging, and in our case is an organic consequence of multiple factors: We specify that our Voting tokens (A shares equivalent) have no monetary value; And our Loot tokens (dividend shares equivalent) are pegged to the Dollar. Neither represents a share in any entity, remember there's none, just an accounting and execution tool.

This also eases a lot of the path for management and compliance by grace of being able to budget and register everything based on a blockchain standard FIAT-equivalent asset, universal enough to cover any potential member location and disparate jurisdictions.

While the priority is their logic and experimental utility, we also hope these changes set apart our tokens from their "security" origins to offer an extra safety layer for our activities. In any case, we act and require ALL our members to act, as-if-they-were securities[^18]. Even when they are not capable of generating a big fundraiser, and are useless outside of participating in the DAO, or keeping tabs on how a participant is remunerated for what we together will create.

Formulating our DAO token pair more like internal tools of participation, and accounting for those wanting to be an active part of the project, makes their utility last as long as the original project operates, that is, as long as the full set of objectives are not met.

Having limited roles and expiration introduces the necessity to develop something that keeps on existing after the DAO concludes, and bridge what we created there with what we'll be doing next.

This is, bridging the tools we'll need to develop in our starting chain[^19], which ought to connect or move into our own chain that we'll develop.

The planned utilities for this token are diverse, but not that different from those of a conventional project. Here we stop pushing the envelope and rather drive predictably.

Remember that our end-game is dealing with real assets, which usually imply passing through processes and institutions of the real economy. So the concept and main utility of our utility tokens is to be **a PASS into that real-life context** from the original virtual-blockchain one. They inherit a bit of the principles of the AXX token, to be a tool for holding and executing membership access, just that these will have a monetary value and inherent value transfer utility.

And after that, there are plenty of things we can do with those tokens derived from the diversity of things we do across the board. So these tokens are like a canvas in which we will sketch our big picture and validate our ideas aiming to implement them in our definitive chain.

For this reason, we have an aggressive offering plan meant to allow for up to 70% of the issuance to be in the hands of the community, as soon as possible. It takes a bit from the DAO pair philosophy in disregarding massive sales in exchange for low overhead, community access, and early participation.

Funds raised from our utility tokens are still approved for use by the DAO but they are managed in specific Treasuries earmarked to specific funding stages **matched** to specific sale stages. Since some of those assets might come from chains or instruments not directly compatible with the Gnosis chain or the DAO treasuries, there will be the need to hold those in cold wallets until a 3^rd^ party custodial service can be hired for definitive guardianship.

We don't make hard plans for this because we will always prefer and recommend that you make your contributions in the top tiers of those "Receivable crypto assets" referenced in our Agreement Terms and Conditions[^20]. Starting with the native xDai, and alternatively, the referenced dollar-pegged (wrapped) coins and tokens. Any other asset should be converted into a native one for DAO's consumption as required.

Given this overview of the rationality of our token triad, let's get specific about them.

## 5.0 Tokenomics

The project is based on DAOHaus' Moloch V3 DAO model but assigns different attributes and dynamics to their tokens in sync with the operational format we described in the previous section.

An always updated, detailed, technical overview of our tokens, allocations, and operations is provided in our web's tokenomics section: [https://dao.arcadia.global/tokenomics](https://dao.arcadia.global/tokenomics) - A technical brief with all relevant links is also referenced at the end of this document.

You can review that before or after the following high-level overview of the tokens, which is also available in the Agreement Terms and Conditions (ATC) document.

### 5.1 DAO Pair -- Voting Token - AXX

![AXXION token image](/axxion-2c.png)

The voting token is a membership token that confers its holder the power to vote on the different proposals submitted by managers and the community into the DAO\'s web3 platform. This token does not have any monetary value, nor represents a share or equity in any entity. It doesn\'t affect, share, or modify the inherent value of the other token member of the pair. No future plan to assign value to this token will be implemented, and no utility other than remaining a proof of membership into the Staging DAO is promised.

The project can\'t prevent its holders from establishing a secondary market for this token based on this inherent utility, and in that order of ideas, it can\'t back, support, or be obligated to integrate such dynamics into the future operations within the scope of the Staging DAO, or beyond.

AXX tokens are only granted, in a relation 1:1 with loot tokens, to members contributing funds into the DAO\'s common pool.

### 5.2 DAO Pair -- Loot Token -- rAXX

![reAXXION token image](/reaxxion-2c.png)

The loot tokens are peg-like tokens tied to the value of the US Dollar and are used to keep track -referencing this FIAT currency- of the community's contributions be them in the form of other cryptoassets, or in the form of professional work done for the project. Loot tokens give proportional rights to claim back a share of the common pool of resources in case a participant wants to exit the project while in process.

No functions comparable or equivalent to equity, securities, or revenue promise are offered to holders of this token while the Staging DAO is in operation. Upon completion of the staging objectives, the tokens can be vested on their originally stated peg value. The project will offer paths to buyback in kind or swap this value into its future tokens at preferential terms.

rAXX tokens are granted 1:1 to members contributing funds **or** work into the project, according to their progressive stepped sale stage value, or nominal value, respectively.

### 5.3 ERC20 -- Utility Token -- PAXX

![PRAXXIS token image](/praxxis-2c.png)

The project\'s utility tokens are created to serve internal and external users as a pass into the future services provided by the project, the platforms, and integrations with real assets we\'ll develop. This is a proxy-upgradable token set up to be a plain canvas for experimentation in adapting the EVM paradigms into our real-life processes. Beyond its inherent value transfer utility, this token helps us to sketch the blueprints of our own chain's native tokens, to which a bridge is almost obligatory.

The tokens are offered by the DAO committee to the market in general. PAXX tokens are available in a combination of conventional crypto asset offerings and sales methods, to KYC-validated users and institutions, and are in discussions to be listed in selected decentralized and/or centralized exchanges.

### 5.4 Sales

#### 5.4.1 DAO Pair Token --- AXXION + reAXXION

We developed the **Stepped Progressive Sale Model** as a way to hardcode the caps for a peg-like token in a continuous presale stage. Is based on a linear decimal model to make the fundraising aspect entirely predictable:

- 1<sup>st</sup> stage: Get 100,000 rAXX tokens @ \$0,1 USD e/a -- Fundraising \$10,000
- 2<sup>nd</sup> stage: Get 100,000 rAXX tokens @ \$0,2 USD e/a -- Fundraising \$20,000
- 3<sup>rd</sup> stage: Get 100,000 rAXX tokens @ \$0,3 USD e/a -- Fundraising \$30,000

And so on up to stage 7<sup>th</sup> to be well below the 50% of the total hypothetical fundraising potential by capitalizing 1 Million tokens @ \$1 USD. The 50% is crossed by the 10<sup>th</sup>  stage for a total hypothetical hardcap of \$550,000 USD.

#### 5.4.2 ERC20 Utility token --- PRAXXIS

We aim for 3 conventional sale stages that favor early adoption, fair distribution and open access, in that order: 

- Presale: Get 200,000,000 PAXX tokens @ \$0,0005 e/a -- Fundraising \$100,000 as seed funds.
- Fair: Get 300,000,000 PAXX tokens in different auction formats and platforms TBA.
- DEX: Offering 200,000,000 PAXX tokens accessible by DEX.

## 7.0 Roadmap

![Staging roadmap graphic](/af-dao-roadmap.png)

This is a representation of our task progression, changes and adaptations are expected; Is not a timeline or schedule formulation.

## 8.0 Participation

We aim to be a beginner friendly DAO that is accessible to contributors, workers, and institutions of all experience levels. There are no minimum participation/actions required to be a member, and the operational overhead in TX fees is kept at the very minimum.

In practical and operational terms, what we are going to do, and the correct reasons why the public should participate in our project can be summarized as follows:

### 8.1 Disclaimers and Guidelines

1. The global project is not a 100% crypto one, the DAO is.
2. The project only makes payments to entities which are DAO members.
3. The project isn't developing a single final blockchain product for the pubic.
4. The project setup limits speculative dynamics.
5. The project shouldn't use indiscriminate massive or automated marketing.
6. The project's risks are orthogonal with conventional Blockchain risk analysis.

### 8.2 Operations

Our operations are not different from those of a committee focused on developing a new product. With additional roles related to fundraising and organic promotion.

For participants, the gated community channels are the place for exclusive updates, discussion, and pooling; While the DAO is the place for actual execution.

3<sup>rd</sup> party interactions are also approved by DAO, via proposal or signal voting.

All funds movements must be approved by -or logged in- the DAO's chain space.

Please refer to the DAO participation diagram[^21] for a graphic overview of the DAO setup.

### 8.3 Workers

Our airdrop[^22] onboarding method allows anyone to become an applicant for a position in the DAO. Progressively selecting based on experience and on results towards conforming the core team which will be hired by the DAO for continuous participation, and given a salary based on their time reserved for the project.

Contractors or freelance specialists are also taken into account, just that they participate by making proposals offering their services, and requesting in exchange Loot tokens at their nominal value.

![Roles and access table](/roles+access-table.jpg)

*Fig. 1: Roles and Access table from the Tokenomics web page.*

As opposed to team and contractors,**founder/s can't hold or vest any DAO pair tokens**. They are only remunerated with a biweekly salary of 1% of the total funds managed at that point in time. Keeping the clean room sealed, while incentivizing efficiency and fundraising activities.

### 8.4 Contributors

It wouldn't be totally correct to call someone offering crypto assets for their own payroll an investor. The investor word preceded by the word blockchain most of the time implies huge returns and risks associated with volatility.

In that regard, measured or compared with the average crypto project, the DAO token pair hardcodes a pre-set ROI limit and are limited to internal exchange, with the upside being that the overall project is not as risky.

Meanwhile, our utility tokens offer a more conventional risk and return proposition, as the complement of the fundraising options of the DAO pair, they'll provide the bulk of the project's funding.

By design, we are separating these 2 dynamics (internal and external utility) to where they matter most for our experimental purposes.

### 8.5 Rewards

We compensate for this lack of immediate ROI with the unusual opportunity for almost anyone to become part of the future enterprise's team. The plan is to migrate the Staging roles from the DAO into the Foundation proper.

Needless to say, being part of the Staging DAO automatically gives participants the earliest access possible to the next fundraising efforts that will be in line with more conventional crypto projects, as long as that access doesn't conflict with their inherited position.

But even bigger opportunities are available for those participants who remember the scope of this project and realize that the big returns are in the tangible assets we'll be handling in-real-life, and are in a position to also participate in these initiatives from their locations.

### 8.6 Use of Funds

Not being a project entirely focused on developing a single technology or product, alas, not entirely prioritizing software development, drives the assignment of the funds in a more conventional arrangement, which we estimated in the following graph:

![Use of funds pie chart](/use-of-funds.jpg)

*Fig. 2: Estimated use of fund for staging work.*
